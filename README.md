# Oiplikao.FastRespawn
R2Northstar mod that makes respawning faster and button-press-free by automatically spawning you when the "Respawn" prompt is available.

**This doesn't make respawn TRULY instant.** It doesn't skip your "ragdollcam" and you'll still see about half a second of the kill replay. The speed is the same as if you were mashing the button.

To cancel instant respawn, hold Right Shift before the "Respawn" prompt appears. Use it when you want to watch the replay or spawn in a Titan.
